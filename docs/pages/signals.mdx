# Signals

Urban-js now has signals!! :rocket:

## Introduction
Signals are trending at the moment as the most recommended way to manage global and local state.
❤️
There are even rumours that signals are being considered as a native JS language feature. 

Our implementation of Signals is built on preact's implementation. To make it work, we use a Babel tranformer to convert our components to reactive components.

To read more about what problems signals solve, check out [Introduction to Signals in Preact](https://preactjs.com/blog/introducing-signals/)

## Usage

Using signals is pretty simple. 

 ```js
import { useSignal } from "urban-core"

 export default Home() {
    const count = useSignal(0);
   
     <div>
                <span className="text-underline mb-8">Signals Demo</span>
                <p>
                    <>Value: {count}</>
                </p>
                <button onClick={() => count.value++}>Increment</button>
                <button onClick={() => count.value--}>Decrement</button>
            </div>
}
```

Yes, it's that simple. 

We also export more powerful features like compute, useCompute and effect 

Docs on the above are coming soon. 

Meantime, ENJOY SIGNALS!
