# File-Based Routing (FBR) in Urban Framework

## Introduction

File-Based Routing (FBR) in the Urban Framework provides an intuitive and efficient way to manage routing in your web application. It is inspired by the `pages` directory structure in Next.js, offering similar functionalities with additional enhancements.

## Basic Routing

### Overview

The basic routing in Urban is straightforward. Each file inside the `pages` directory corresponds to a route based on its file name.

### Example

- `pages/index.tsx` responds to the root URL `/`.
- `pages/about.tsx` corresponds to `/about`.

## Dynamic Routes

### Overview

Urban supports dynamic routing using special character files, similar to Next.js. It allows you to create routes based on file names enclosed in square brackets.

### Usage

- A file named `[slug].tsx` in the `pages` directory will match any path like `/anything`.
- The value of the path segment will be passed to your page component as a prop.

### Example

- `pages/blog/[slug].tsx` will respond to any route like `/blog/my-first-post`.

## Nested Routes

### Overview

Nested routing is seamlessly handled in the Urban Framework. This feature allows you to create a rich folder structure inside the `pages` directory to represent nested URLs.

### Implementation

- Create a folder for each segment of the path.
- Place the corresponding `.tsx` file inside the folder.

### Example

- To create a route for `/blog/2020/post`, create the following structure:
  - `pages/blog/2020/post.tsx`.

## Handling 404 Errors

### Custom 404 Pages

Urban automatically supports 404 pages. Creating a `404.tsx` file in the `pages` directory will automatically make it the default 404 error page.

### Implementation

- Simply create a `404.tsx` file in the `pages` directory.
- Style and customize this page as required.

### Example

- `pages/404.tsx` will be displayed for any unmatched route, providing a customized 404 error page.

## Conclusion

File-Based Routing in Urban offers a flexible and easy-to-use system for handling your application's routing needs. With support for dynamic and nested routes, along with custom 404 pages, it streamlines the development process and enhances the user experience.
